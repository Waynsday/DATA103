    "As budding Data Scientists, one of the tasks that you have to do after building you model is to create a model report. The model report acts as a documentation to understand the analytic approach that was done in order to solve a problem. This documentation is important since it allows your colleagues to review and critic your approach.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the different sections of the model report:\n",
    "- Summary - This contains a high level description of the approach done to solve the problem along with the resultsand findings of your study. \n",
    "- Data Preprocessing - This section contains a short description and shows the code on how the data was processed to prep it for modeling\n",
    "- Model Development - This section contains a short description and the code as to how the model was developed \n",
    "- Results/Model Performance - This section contains a summary of the different algorithms used and metrics that was achieved in the model development phase \n",
    "- Model Interpretability - This section discusses the important features used by the model and insights on the top features. Model here will be the model recommended by the data scientist that business will use. \n",
    "- Recommendation - This section details the next steps and improvements that can be done \n",
    "\n",
    "You are applying for a Data Scientist position at Keebs Loan. You have been asked to create a draft model report which contains the different sections mentioned and will be evalulated based on the rubric placed in Canvas. The interviewer has also placed an additional constraint, **you are not allowed to use KNN or Logistic Regression for the report and have been requested to impute missing values instead of dropping them.**"

    "The dataset is a compilation of loan applications that contained borrower's demographics including the loan details and their actual results. The goal of this model report is to compare two models: Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, in the application of predictively classifying a loan application for approval or for rejection. The two models were selected on the basis of their raw computational needs wherein the SVM model is expected to require less time than the RF model. The dataset was pre-processed by imputing all the categorical null values using the mode of the dataset while replacing null numerical values with the dataset's mean. Then, two models were generated: the SVM and RF, where the former was subjected to hyperparameter optimization due to the fact that the SVM is a single model while RF is an ensemble learner. The resulting models showed the SVM outperforming the RF model in accuracy (76.22%), precision (73.46%), and F1 score (84.40%) with only its recall (99.17%) underperforming. In comparison, the RF resulted in an accuracy of 70.27%, a precision of 68.57%, a recall of 100%, and an F1 score of 81.36%. While in this experiment the SVM outperformed the RF model, this loss can be attributed to the lack of parameter optimization with the RF model. Thus, it is recommended that in future model evaluations, the RF model should be subjected to hyperparameter tuning as well. Other recommendations include exploring other algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNN, neural networks, and the like."

    "Explaining each model starting with the SVM, the SVM model highlights credit history to be largest indicator of loan rejection. In terms of location, semi-urban and rural locations indicate likelihood of loan approval surprisingly. The loan amount plays a significant role in the SVM model as well with that variable showing higher loan amounts to incidate higher likelihood of approval and lower loan amounts indicate a lower likelihood of approval. Intuitively, it makes sense given the higher profitability of large loans rather than smaller loans. \n",
